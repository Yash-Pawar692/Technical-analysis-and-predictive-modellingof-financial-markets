The Project is divided into two parts: Technical analysis and Predictive modelling 
Technical Analysis is important in investing/ trading as it shows the sentiment in the market and also of any particular company by its price and the volume traded. 
This technical analysis includes
- Candlestic patterns
- Volume trends
- Moving averages and crossovers.
- Relative Strength Index.
- Resistance and support

Predictive Modelling is used to understand where the stock will reach in terms of price if there is no abnormal change in the market. This provides the actual transaction guide while the technical analysis provides you with the tools to make the actual change.
Different algorithms considered for predictive modelling are LSTM, CNN and Linear regression.
